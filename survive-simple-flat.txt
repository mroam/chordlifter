(a)At
^{Am} first I was afraid, I was ^{Dm} petrified, kept thinking
^{G} I could never live without you ^{CM7} by my side. But then I
^{FM7} (e)spent so many nights thinkin' ^{BbM7/b} how you did me wrong, and I grew
^{Esus} strong, and I learned ^{E} how to get along.

And so you're 
^{Am} back, from outer space;^{Dm} I just walked
^{G} in to find you here with that sad ^{CM7} look upon your face. I should have
^{FM7} changed that stupid lock, I should have ^{BbM7/b} made you leave your key if I'd've
^{Esus} known for just one second you'd be ^{E} back to bother me.

Go on now
^{Am} Go, walk out the ^{Dm} door, just turn a-
^{G} round now, cause you're not ^{CM7} welcome anymore.
^{FM7}Weren't you the one who tried to ^{BbM7/b} hurt me w/ goodbye? Think I'd
^{Esus4} crumble? Think I'd ^{E} lay down and die? Oh no, not
^{Am} I. I will sur-^{Dm} vive. Oh as
^{G} long as I know how to love I ^{CM7} know I'll stay alive; I've got
^{FM7} all my life to live, I've got ^{BbM7/b} all my love to give and I'll sur-
^{Esus}-vive, I will sur-^{E}-vive. Hey, hey.

^{Am} (d5 c, a4 c5 g) ^{Dm} (f, e d c b4 a)
^{G} (b g, b g5) ^{CM7} (e e e d d d c c b4 b)
^{FM7} (a e5 f) ^{BbM7/b} (f e d c b5 a g f) ^{Esus} (e) ^{E}

<verse>It took
^{Am} all the strength I had not to ^{Dm} fall apart; kept tryin'
^{G} hard to mend the pieces of my ^{CM7} broken heart. And I spent,
^{FM7} oh, so many nights just feelin' ^{BbM7/b} sorry for myself. I used to
^{Esus} cry, but now I ^{E} hold my head up high, and you see</verse>

<verse>
^{Am} me, somebody ^{Dm} new, I'm not that
^{G} chained up little person still in ^{CM7} love with you. And so you
^{FM7} felt like droppin' in and just ex-^{BbM7/b} pect me to be free. Now I'm
^{Esus} savin' all my lovin' for some-^{E} one who's lovin' me.</verse>
