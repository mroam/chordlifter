Capo 1 to be in Am

{F G Em Am}

{F}We're no strangers to {G}love
{F}You know the rules and {G}so do I
{F}A full commitment's what I'm {G}thinking of
{F}You wouldn't get this from any {G}other guy
{F}I just wanna {G}tell you how I'm feeling
{F}Gotta make you {G}understand

<chorus> Never gonna 
{F}give you {G}up, Never gonna {Em}let you {Am}down. Never gonna 
{F}run a-{G}-round and de-{E}-sert {Am} you. Never gonna 
{F}make you {G}cry. Never gonna {Em}say good{Am}bye. Never gonna 
{F}tell a {G}lie and {E}hurt {Am}you
</chorus>

<verse2>
{F}We've known each other {G}for so long
{F}Your heart's been aching but {G}you're too shy to say it
{F}Inside we both know what's been {G}going on
{F}We know the game and we're {G}gonna play it
{F}And if you {G}ask me how I'm feeling
{F}Don't tell me you're too {G}blind to see
</verse2>
