Thought I'd end up with Sean
                E7
But he wasn't a match
                       Am7
Wrote some songs about Ricky
                 C7
Now I listen and laugh
                Fmaj7
Even almost got married
                     E7
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
                                 Am7
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
                 C7
'Cause he was an angel
 
[Pre-Chorus]
              Fmaj7
One taught me love
              E7
One taught me patience
                  Am7
And one taught me pain
             C7
Now, I'm so amazing
                    Fmaj7
I've loved and I've lost
                    E7
But that's not what I see
                Am7
So, look what I got
              C7
Look what you taught me
                Fmaj7
And for that, I say
 
[Chorus]
                 E7
Thank you, next (Next)
                 Am7
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next
C7                             Fmaj7
I'm so f***in' grateful for my ex
                 E7
Thank you, next (Next)
                 Am7
Thank you, next (Next)
Thank you, next (Next)
C7
I'm so f***in'
 
[Verse 2]
                        Fmaj7
Spend more time with my friends
                      E7
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
                    Am7
Plus, I met someone else
                    C7
We havin' better discussions
                       Fmaj7
I know they say I move on too fast
                  E7
But this one gon' last
                   Am7
'Cause her name is Ari
                     C7
And I'm so good with that (So good with that)
 
[Pre-Chorus]
              Fmaj7
She taught me love (Love)
              E7
She taught me patience (Patience)
                Am7
How she handles pain (Pain)
             C7
That s***'s amazing (Yeah, she's amazing)
                    Fmaj7
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
                    E7
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
                      Am7
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
                  C7                         Fmaj7
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say
 
[Chorus]
                            E7
Thank you, next (Thank you, next)
                            Am7

Thank you, next
Thank you, next
C7
I'm so f***ing
 
[Bridge]
                           Fmaj7
One day I'll walk down the aisle
                      E7
Holding hands with my mama
                    Am7
I'll be thanking my dad
                         C7
'Cause she grew from the drama
                 Fmaj7
Only wanna do it once, real bad
                    E7
Gon' make that s*** last
                     Am7
God forbid something happens
                     C7
Least this song is a smash (Song is a smash)
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                 Fmaj7
I've got so much love (Love)
            E7
Got so much patience (Patience)
                      Am7
I've learned from the pain (Pain)
              C7
I turned out amazing (Turned out amazing)
                    Fmaj7
I've loved and I've lost (Yeah, yeah)
                    E7
But that's not what I see (Yeah, yeah)
                      Am7
'Cause look what I've found (Yeah, yeah)
                  C7
Ain't no need for searching

And for that, I'll say
 
[Chorus]
                            E7
