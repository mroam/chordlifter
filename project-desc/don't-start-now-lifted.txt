don’t start now
note: needs fixed pitch font!

Bm                    D       Em   pause
 If you don’t want to see me

<verse 1>
               Em      Bm
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
G
Thinking bout the way
  D            A          Em         Bm
I was. Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
    G                     D       A
But look at where I ended up..

</verse1>

<pre chorus>
        Em
I'm all good already
         Bm
So moved on, it's scary
        G                    D   A
I'm not where you left me at all, so
Bm                   D                       Em      G
If you don’t want to see me dancin’ with somebody 
Bm             D                         Em       G
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

<chorus>
           Em
Don't show up
           Bm
Don't come out
            G               D    A
Don't start caring about me now.
      Em            Bm
Walk away, you know how
            G               D        pause
Don't start caring about me now.

</chorus>

<verse2>
               Em
Aren't you the guy who
Bm       G                          D
Tried to hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
         A         Em      Bm
'Fore it took some time to survive you
    G                   D     A
I'm better on the other side..
