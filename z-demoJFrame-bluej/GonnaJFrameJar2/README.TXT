Trying to get executable standalone jar files 
based on Kyle Dencker's "BlueJ- Getting Started with JFrames"
 video tutorial at 
 <a href="https://youtu.be/zuV3JHnSdno">https://youtu.be/zuV3JHnSdno</a>
  
 This is the fancier version w/ paint, w/ JComponent
 and it is working: BlueJ 5.0.3 is running java 11 and is
 able to make Jar referring to JFrameExample2's main() and 
 the Jar can be double-clicked to show a colorful JFrame in 
 macos 12.4 monterey.
 
 Still todo: get mouse clicks working and try to include
 Mike's TicTacToe 3D in a double-clickable jar!
